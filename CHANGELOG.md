## **Project Genesis:**
**BISCUIT (BioImage Segmentation Comparison Utility and Interactive Tool)** traces its roots back to the **Scientific IT Services (SIS)** at ETH Zurich. Spearheaded by **Franziska Oschmann**, the goal was to create an intuitive yet powerful platform for visually comparing cell segmentation models on microscopy data.

The initial version of BISCUIT was built on top of the **Microbial Image Data Analysis Pipeline (MIDAP)** frameworkâ€”a modular system originally developed for analyzing data from Mother Machine experiments. MIDAP's flexible architecture made it a solid foundation for building interactive segmentation workflows.

Development continued in close collaboration with the ETH Zurich imaging center **ScopeM**, with practical contributions and technical leadership by **Szymon Stoma** and **Andrzej Rzepiela**. Together, the team laid the groundwork for a tool that aspires to become a versatile visual benchmarking suite for segmentation models in the Life Sciences.

Rather than creating a traditional fork, we decided to create a clean, optimized copy that focuses specifically on the core segmentation functionality through Jupyter notebooks. This approach allows us to maintain a focused codebase while preserving the powerful segmentation algorithms that have proven effective in biological image analysis.

The project incorporates proven segmentation algorithms and tools that have been developed and tested in the field of microbial data analysis, but presents them in a more accessible, notebook-based format that's easier to use and deploy. As part of SIS's mission to support the scientific community, Biscuit provides researchers with powerful yet accessible tools for microscopy image analysis.

## **Migration Notes:**
- All Git history from the original project has been removed for fresh start
- Repository structure optimized for GitHub Pages deployment
- Focus shifted from GUI applications to notebook-based analysis
- Maintained compatibility with original segmentation algorithms
