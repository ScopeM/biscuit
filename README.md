## 📜 Project History

**BISCUIT (BioImage Segmentation Comparison Utility and Interactive Tool)** traces its roots back to the **Scientific IT Services (SIS)** at ETH Zurich. Spearheaded by **Franziska Oschmann**, the goal was to create an intuitive yet powerful platform for visually comparing cell segmentation models on microscopy data.

The initial version of BISCUIT was built on top of the **Microbial Image Data Analysis Pipeline (MIDAP)** framework—a modular system originally developed for analyzing data from Mother Machine experiments. MIDAP's flexible architecture made it a solid foundation for building interactive segmentation workflows.

Development continued in close collaboration with the ETH Zurich imaging center **ScopeM**, with practical contributions and technical leadership by **Szymon Stoma** and **Andrzej Rzepiela**. Together, the team laid the groundwork for a tool that aspires to become a versatile visual benchmarking suite for segmentation models in the Life Sciences.

Rather than creating a traditional fork, we decided to create a clean, optimized copy that focuses specifically on the core segmentation functionality through Jupyter notebooks. This approach allows us to maintain a focused codebase while preserving the powerful segmentation algorithms that have proven effective in biological image analysis.
